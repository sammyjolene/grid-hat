# Grid Hat
This program will print the grid that can be used to crochet a winter hat with letters. The letters are on 6 columns x 8 rows. The total grid can be up to 17 rows x 40 columns

Here is a pictureo of a completed hat:

Typically I draw out patters on grid paper until I have a good fit and then make the hat. The patter typically takes 1-2 hours. This program will automatically do that for me.
