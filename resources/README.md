# Grid Hat
This program will print the grid that can be used to crochet a winter hat with letters. Typically I draw out patters on grid paper until I have a good fit and then make the hat. The patter typically takes 1-2 hours. This program will automatically do that for me. 

The letters are on 6 columns x 8 rows. The total grid can be up to 17 rows x 40 columns. 

Here is a picture of a completed hat:

Step I want to complete: 
1. Add a couple letters to begin programming
2. Get the program to print the letters when called upon
3. Get the program to print a word when entered
4. Add all the additional letters
5. Set up rules to check on the size of the word and if it will fit on the hat
